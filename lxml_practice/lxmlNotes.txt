XPath = “XML Path Language.”

It describes where elements live in the hierarchy of tags, attributes, and text nodes.
It’s tree-based, not text-based.

Example : tree.xpath('//div[@class="card"]/span/text()')

Go anywhere (//), find a <div> whose class attribute = 'card', then find its child <span> and get its text.
