Depencies that I have installed will be listed here.

1. Scrapfly API to webscrape

I am having issues bypassing cloudflare when using "request.get"
As of now the solution is to use scrapfly which is able to bypass cloudflare

Concerns: 
    - Cloudflare seems to take a few seconds to fetch data. Not sure if this is typical for webscraping. As of now it is not a big issue but I may need
      to look into alternatives eventually
